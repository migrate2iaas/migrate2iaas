## Migrate2Iaas Cloudscraper

Cloudscraper is a simple software tool to migrate your servers to Cloud (see http://www.migrate2iaas.com web site).
Starting from version 6.6 it's free to use and open-source.

### How it works?
Cloudscraper is installed on a source physical and virtual machine. 

Cloudscraper creates a snapshot image of the system, and virtualizes the image.

Then it uploads the image to AWS (Amazon Web Services), Azure, or OpenStack cloud, and creates a VM based on the image.
